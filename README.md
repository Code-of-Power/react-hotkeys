[![NPM](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/react-hotkeys.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-hotkeys) [![JavaScript Style Guide](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-standard-brightgreen.svg)](https://standardjs.com)

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @code_of_power/react-hotkeys
```

## Features

- Ability to assign several keyboard shortcuts to one action.
- Ability to use keyboard shortcuts only for a specific part of the user interface (Zone feature).
- Declarate/Imperative approach. You can use component or inject instance of service for work with hotkeys.
- Using React hooks.
- Hotkeys can be mixed with mouse buttons and mouse events.
- Helper component for form inputs for prevent bubbling events from inputs.

## Base usage

```tsx
import React, { FC } from 'react'
import { HotkeyZone, IHotkeyEvent, IHotkeyRegistry, Key } from 'react-hotkeys'

enum E_ACTIONS {
  CTRL_ALT_L = 'CTRL_ALT_L',
  M = 'M'
}

const HOTKEYS: IHotkeyRegistry[] = [
  {
    action: E_ACTIONS.CTRL_ALT_L,
    keys: [[Key.Ctrl, Key.Alt, Key.L]]
  },
  {
    action: E_ACTIONS.M,
    keys: [[Key.M]]
  }
]

const Example: FC = () => {
  const hotkeyHnd = useCallback(
    (e: IHotkeyEvent<E_ACTIONS>) => console.warn(e),
    []
  )

  return (
    <HotkeyZone hotkeys={HOTKEYS} onHotkeyEvent={hotkeyHnd} zone='my-zone'>
      <div tabIndex={1}></div>
    </HotkeyZone>
  )
}
```

P.S:

- Action of `IHotkeyRegistry` was be unique value
- For correct work `HotkeyZone` component using `tabIndex` for child node.
- Some hotkeys can't be handled even when using `e.preventDefault()`, because it reserved of browser. Be careful, see the documentation of the browser you are using.
